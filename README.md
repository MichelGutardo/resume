## About me
Over 10 years I initially worked as an IT technician doing computer maintenance until I started managing Windows and Linux servers, but from the beginning, I had affection for programming. Even working with infrastructure, I wanted to be involved in parallel with small projects of desktop or web systems, to prototype games and simulators.

I migrated definitively to the programming area when working with ERP Totvs Protheus using the ADVPL language, but always keeping an open mind for other technologies, besides being something pleasurable, I can add something new to the company.
